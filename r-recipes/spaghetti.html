        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            My family requests this recipe every year for birthday parties and other events! It's crowd- and family-friendly, as well as easy to make ahead and then refrigerate!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>â…” cup Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup cottage cheese, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix eggs, Parmesan cheese, and butter with the spaghetti to coat pasta completely; spread into the prepared baking dish. Spread cottage cheese over the spaghetti to cover completely. Spread spaghetti sauce over the cottage cheese; top with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until hot in the center, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
